This repository demonstrates a common bug in React's `useState` hook related to shallow comparisons when working with objects. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, where modifying a nested property of the state object doesn't trigger a re-render. The `bugSolution.js` file presents a solution using the spread operator or immutability libraries to ensure that React detects the changes and re-renders the component correctly.
